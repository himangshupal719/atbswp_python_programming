Foor loop

The while loop keeps looping while its condition is True.
What if you want to execute a block of code only a certain number of times? You can do this with a for loop statement and the range() function.

In code, a for statement looks something like for i in range(5): and includes the following:

- The for keyword
- A variable name
- The in keyword
- A call to the range() method with up to three integers passed to it
- A colon
- Starting on the next line, an indented block of code (called the for clause)

You can use break and continue statements inside for loops as well. The continue statement will continue to the next value of the for loopâ€™s counter, as if the program execution had reached the end of the loop and returned to the start. In fact, you can use continue and break statements only inside while and for loops. If you try to use these statements elsewhere, Python will give you an error.

The Starting, Stopping, and Stepping Arguments to range()

for i in range(12, 16):
    print(i)

The range() function can also be called with three arguments. The first two arguments will be the start and stop values, and the third will be the step argument. The step is the amount that the variable is increased by after each iteration.

for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(i)
