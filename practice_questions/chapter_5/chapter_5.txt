1. What does the code for an empty dictionary look like?
{}

2. What does a dictionary value with a key 'foo' and a value 42 look like?
{'foo':42}

3. What is the main difference between a dictionary and a list?
- Unlike indexes for lists, indexes for dictionaries can use many different data types, not just integers. 
- Unlike lists, items in dictionaries are unordered.While the order of items matters for determining whether two lists are the same, it does not matter in what order the key-value pairs are typed in a dictionary. Because dictionaries are not ordered, they can’t be sliced like lists.

4. What happens if you try to access spam['foo'] if spam is {'bar': 100}?
It will throw kyeError.

5. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.keys()?

>>> spam = {'cat': 100}
>>> 'cat' in spam
True
>>> 'cat' in spam.keys()
True

Ther is no difference. 
'cat' in spam will check if the value 'cat' is a key in spam dictionary. 
'cat' in spam.keys() is same as above . 'cat' is being checked for keys of the dictionary spam.

6. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.values()?
'cat' in spam will check if the value 'cat' is a key in spam dictionary. 
'cat' in spam will check if the value 'cat' is a value in spam dictionary. 

7. What is a shortcut for the following code? 
if 'color' not in spam:
    spam['color'] = 'black'
	
spam.setdefault('color': 'black')
	
8. What module and function can be used to “pretty print” dictionary values?
module - pprint
function - pprint 
import pprint
pprint.pprint(spam) 

>>> import pprint
>>> pprint.pprint(spam)
{'cat': 100, 'color': 'black'}
