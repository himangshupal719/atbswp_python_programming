1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?
 - Reduce redundant codes 
 - Groups code that gets executed multiple times
 - Make programs easy to maintain

2. When does the code in a function execute: when the function is defined or when the function is called?
- When the function is called.

3. What statement creates a function?
- def statement creates functions.

4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?
- Function is a block of codes perform a task. Fuction can not executs by itself. 
- Functon call executes the codes inside a function. 

5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?
- Global scope
	- Variable declared outside of a function definition. 
	- Variable declared with global statement in a function. 
	- Variable used in a function, which is not assigned a value in a function is a global variable. 

- Local scope
	- variable declared inside a function

6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?
- Variable gets destroyed. 

7. What is a return value? Can a return value be part of an expression?
- The value that a function call evaluates to is called the return value of the function
When creating a function using the def statement, we can specify what the return value should be with a return statement. A return statement consists of the following:
	- The return keyword
	- The value or expression that the function should return
When an expression is used with a return statement, the return value is what this expression evaluates to.

8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?
- None

9. How can you force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable?
- with global keyword. 

10. What is the data type of None?
- None type

11. What does the import areallyourpetsnamederic statement do?
- Impots module 'areallyourpetsnamederic'

12. If you had a function named bacon() in a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
- spam.bacon()

13. How can you prevent a program from crashing when it gets an error?
- Program crashes due to error or exception. By handling exceptions using try - except block a program can be prevented from crashing. 

14. What goes in the try clause? What goes in the except clause?
- The code that could potentially have an error is put in a try clause.
- The program execution moves to the start of a following except clause if an error happens.
