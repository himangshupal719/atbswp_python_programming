1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
True and False

2. What are the three Boolean operators?
and, or, not

3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible 
combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).

AND - 
True and True = True
True and False = False
False and True = False
False and False = False

OR - 
True or True = True
True or Flase = True
False or True = True
False or False = False

NOT - 
Not True = False
Not False = True

4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?
	(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) --> True and False --> False
	not (5 > 4) --> not True --> False
	(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) --> True or False --> True
	not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) --> not (True or False) --> not True --> False
	(True and True) and (True == False) --> True and False --> False
	(not False) or (not True) --> True or False --> True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
==
!=
<
>
<=
>=

6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?
Euqal to operator (==) is a comparison operator where as the assignment operator (=) is to assign a value to a variable. 

7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.
Boolean expressions can be considered as conditions. Flow control statemnts often starts with condition and are always followed by a block of code called the clause.
A flow control statement decides what to do based on whether its condition is True or False and almose every flow control statement uses a condition. 

8. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs') --> block 1 start
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon') --> block 2
    else:
        print('ham') --> block 3
    print('spam') --> block 1 end
print('spam')

9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
See question_9.py

10. What keys can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?
Control + c

11. What is the difference between break and continue?
Break will break the loop and go to the next statement out side of the loop. 
Continue will take the control back the begening of the loop. 

12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?
range(10) = For loop will start at 0 to end at 9
range(0, 10) = For loop will start at 0 and end at 9
range(0, 10, 1) = For loop will start at 0, end at 9 and increment by 1

13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
See question_13.py

14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
import spam
spam.bacon()

Extra credit: Look up the round() and abs() functions on the internet, and find out what they do. Experiment with them in the interactive shell.
Python built in function link for abs(): https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#abs
abs() finction returns the absolute value of a number. The argument may be an integer, a floating point number or an object implementing __abs__().
If the argument is a complex number, its magnitude is returned. 
>>> abs(10)
10
>>> abs(10.234)
10.234
>>> abs(-10)
10

Python built in function link for round(): https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round
round() function returns number rounded to ndigits precesion afte the decial point. If ndigits is omitted or is None, it returns then eares integer to its input. 
>>> round(2.675,2)
2.67
>>> round(2.6755,3)
2.675
>>> round(10.6755,4)
10.6755
>>> round(10.6756,4)
10.6756
>>> round(10,676)
10
>>> round(10.676)
11
>>> round(10.676,2)
10.68
>>> round(10.675,2)
10.68
>>> round(10.657,2)
10.66
>>> round(10.665,2)
10.66
