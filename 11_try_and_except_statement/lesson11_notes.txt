Getting an error, or exception, in your Python program means the entire program will crash. You donâ€™t want this to happen in real-world programs. Instead, you want the program to detect errors, handle them, and then continue to run.

Errors can be handled with try and except statements.

The code that could potentially have an error is put in a try clause. The program execution moves to the start of a following except clause if an error happens.

Note that any errors that occur in function calls in a try block will also be caught. 

Once the execution jumps to the code in the except clause, it does not return to the try clause. Instead, it just continues moving down the program as normal.

When the user presses CTRL-C while a Python program is running, Python raises the KeyboardInterrupt exception.
