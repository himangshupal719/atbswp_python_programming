----------
Expression - 2 +2 , 2 (Values combined with operators)
Expressions consist of values (such as 2) and operators (such as +), and they can always evaluate (that is, reduce) down to a single value. 
A single value with no operators is also considered an expression, though it evaluates only to itself

Operators: 
** Exponent --> 2**3 = 8
% Modulus/Remainder --> 22%8=6
// Integer division/Floored quotient --> 22//8 = 2
/ Division --> 22/8 = 2.75
* Multiplication --> 3*5 = 15
- Subtraction --> 5-2 = 3
+ Addition --> 2+2 = 4


Order of Operator/precedence (left to right)
1. Parentheses
2. Multiplication / Division
3. Addition / Subtraction

**, *, /, //, %, +, -

Use parentheses to override the usual precedence

Data Type:A data type is a category for values, and every value belongs to exactly one data type.
Integers - ints - whole numbers. 42
Floating point number - floats - Numbers with a decimal point. 42.0
Strings - for text values. String with no characters in it, '', called a blank string or an empty string. 

The meaning of an operator may change based on the data types of the values next to it. For example, + is the addition operator when it operates on two integers or floating-point values. However, when + is used on two string values, it joins the strings as the string concatenation operator.
+ String concatenation operator 

The * operator multiplies two integer or floating-point values. But when the * operator is used on one string value and one integer value, it becomes the string replication operator.
* String repetition
'Alice' * 5 
'AliceAliceAliceAliceAlice'

Variable:Can store values in memory using variables. A box that stores single value.
= Assignment statement
spam = 42 
A variable is initialized (or created) the first time a value is stored in it. After that, you can use it in expressions with other variables and values. When a variable is assigned a new value, the old value is forgotten.This is called overwriting the variable. 
Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning that spam, SPAM, Spam, and sPaM are four different variables. 
Use camelcase for variable names - e.g. lookLikeThis

Statement:
spam = 2 + 2

Evaluates = Expression (Sigle value)
Doesn't evaluate = Statement (Otherwise more than single vlue)
